# A11yuu: Accessibility Tools for Highly-Interactive User Interfaces 
A11yuu is a unified set of JavaScript helper functions and methods, as well as a suggested naming convention for DOM element id's and CSS classes, that will improve web accessibility on any website where the developer has access to implement changes at the level of native HTML5. The code is primarily concerned with UI affordances that are commonly used in cinematic, storytelling, and interactive/exploratory websites—such as a lightbox effect, animated fading-in and -out, modal dialogs, and tabbed interfaces. Although the code was originally developed for websites built in Webflow, most of its tools are easily adapted to other “low-code” platforms or HTML5 sites.

This code was prototyped in 2022-2023 by [**auut studio**](https://findauut.com) in a partnership with [**Full Spectrum Education**](https://www.fullspectrum.education/) to build the interactive web experience titled [*Resettlement: Chicago Story*](https://www.fullspectrum.education/projects/rcs). The impetus, however, began in 2020, when [Full Spectrum Features NFP](https://www.fullspectrumfeatures.com/)) committed itself to accessibility as a co-equal priority in their filmmaking and digital projects. Accessibility is now a part of their core value of inclusivity; this evolution of thinking is more fully described in the [Accessibility Statement](https://www.fullspectrum.education/resettlement/a11y) of 
*Resettlement: Chicago Story.*

This repository is being published as “version 1.0” in July 2024. Beginning in August 2024, we invites pull requests from web developers who have improvements, suggestions, or additional solutions that improve this toolset.
