# a11y-highly-interactive-UIs
HTML5 + JavaScript + CSS solutions to improve web accessibility on common, but complicated, affordances often used in interactive storytelling websites. 

This code was originally developed in 2022-2023 by [**auut studio**](https://findauut.com) for the benefit of [**Full Spectrum Education**](https://www.fullspectrum.education/)**’s** interactive web experience titled [*Resettlement: Chicago Story*](https://www.fullspectrum.education/projects/rcs). Beginning in 2020, Full Spectrum Education (a division of [Full Spectrum Features NFP](https://www.fullspectrumfeatures.com/)) prioritized accessibility in their filmmaking and digital projects as part of a core value of inclusivity— an evolution of thinking that is more fully described in their [Accessibility Statement](https://www.fullspectrum.education/resettlement/a11y).

This repository is being actively published over the course of April 2023. Beginning in May, we invites pull requests from web developers who have improvements, suggestions, or additional solutions that improve this toolset.
